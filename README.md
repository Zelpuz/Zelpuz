- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Taylor (@Zelpuz)
- I'm a graduate student studying air quality in Toronto, Canada. This includes sources of airborne pollution, how airborne pollution spreads, and how it affects our health. Most of my day-to-day research involves analyzing sets of existing air quality and meteorological time-series measurements.
- I primarily use Python for my research, and rely heavily on Pandas, Numpy, etc. If I need fast loops or multithreading, I use Julia. I interface with raw measurements through SQL/Postgres.
- For some use-cases I use R and Igor Pro.
- I also occasionally work with microcontrollers/computers, such as Arduino and Raspi, for deploying low-cost air quality and meteorology sensors.
- In the past I've worked with Java and C as well, but mostly for education; this excludes the pseudo-C++ that Arduino uses, which I've used extensively.
- For research methods: I measure trends and sudden changes in Toronto's traffic emissions with interrupted time-series analyses in a state-space framework. I measure traffic pollution emissions through via dispersion model regression with multiple measurement stations. For better flexibility, I write my own state-space models, rather than use widespread solutions such as SARIMAX or TBATS.
- I have experience in machine learning and data analysis platforms/libraries, including sklearn and Orange.
- Other Python libraries I often use include, but are not limited to: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, and scipy.
- Weirdly, I've also got experience working on the Honeywell TDC3000 in a production setting.
