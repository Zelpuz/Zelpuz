- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Zelpuz
- I'm a graduate student researching and studying air quality, sources of airborne pollution, how airborne pollution spreads, and how it affects our health. Most of my day-to-day research involves analyzing sets of existing air quality and meteorological time-series measurements.
- I primarily use Python for my research, and rely heavily on Pandas, Numpy, etc. If I need fast loops or multithreading, I might use Julia.
- For specific use-cases I also use R and Igor Pro.
- I also occasionally work with microcontrollers, such as Arduino, for deploying low-cost air quality and meteorology sensors.
- In the past I've worked with Java and C as well, but mostly for education; this excludes the sorta-C++ that Arduino uses, which I've used quite a lot.
- Weirdly, I've also got experience working on the Honeywell TDC3000 in a production setting.
